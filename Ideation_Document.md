## 🧩 Problem Statement

Farmers across India struggle with:
- Lack of guidance on what crops to grow, leading to losses and low yield.  
- Exploitation by middlemen who reduce farmer profits.  
- Inefficient food distribution through the Public Distribution System (PDS), leaving citizens food insecure.  

There is currently no unified, data-driven platform that connects **farmers, buyers, and communities** effectively.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**AgriConnect** is a smart, full-stack platform that uses **AI, GPS, and market intelligence** to connect the entire food supply chain.

### 🌱 For Farmers
- Provides **AI & GPS-based crop recommendations** using satellite data and real-time market trends.  
- Suggests the **best crops, seeds, and cultivation practices** for specific soil and weather conditions.  

### 🛒 For Sellers (Farmers to Buyers)
- Farmers can **list their produce** by uploading photos and expected prices, similar to OLX/Quikr.  
- Enables **direct buyer-farmer connections**, removing middlemen and ensuring fair trade.  

### 🍚 For Communities (Food Distribution)
- Integrates with **Public Distribution System (PDS)** to send alerts when rations (rice, wheat, dal, oil) are ready for pickup.  
- Includes a **one-tap escalation system** if food is not received, ensuring transparency and accountability.
